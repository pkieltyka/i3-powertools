## Scratch pad

- [ ] scratch terminal, open/launch, etc.
- [ ] scratch browser, open/launch
- [ ] move entire window to scratch pad somewhere..



## App switcher

- [ ] rofi, list windows of a paricular kind, ie. chrome
- [ ] could make our own fake marks? aka tags. 
- [ ] open nautlis in floating window mode.. 



## Scratch

- [ ] setup work space, 100: scratch -- or something


## Workspaces

- [ ] move windows from one workspace to another / adjacent



## OSX feel

- [ ] mod+H -- hide a window (aka, scratch it for the workspace)
- [ ] mod+{app switch} -- either open the hidden window from scratch (in last state), or open a new window
- [ ] mod+X -- rofi to show hidden windows, on each workspace, like Expose.. maybe group hidden and otherwise
- [ ] mod+` -- switch to other window of same kind on the screen
	* or mod+` just switch to other window within the same workspace, kinda useful..

- [ ] ctrl+tab	-- lets make these useful, such as switching between last 2 workspaces (with dual monitor support..)
- [ ] alt+tab 	-- perhaps use this in rofi as now..

- [ ] cmd+h for hide, and cmd+ctrl+XXX to open the window up .. 
- [ ] cmd+h to hide stuff, perhaps cmd+o or something to show rofi with windows lists to open from scratch pad..?

- [ ] alt+tab - to switch between focus of windows in a single workspace
- [ ] ctrl+shift+enter (or some combo?) - organize windows to 1/3-2/3 horizontal
